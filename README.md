This is a teeny tiny docker image for nginx built on top of busybox.

Manually build a docker image
-----------------------------
On the docker host, perform the command:

    docker build --tag=nginx-busybox:latest .

Verify that the image has been created:

    docker images
    
should lead to an output similar to:

    REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
    nginx-busybox       latest              5c21ee35c67c        8 hours ago         7.898 MB

Start Container from the above created image
--------------------------------------------
On the docker host, perform the command:

    docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx-busybox

Verify that the container has been created and is up and running:

    docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                         NAMES
